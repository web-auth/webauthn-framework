Webauthn defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users.

This framework contains PHP libraries and Symfony bundle to allow developpers to integrate that authentication mechanism into their web applications.

# Documentation

## Webauthn Library

With this library, you can add multi-factor authentication like FIDO U2F does or add passwordless authentication support for your application using the new FIDO2 Webauthn specification.

There are two steps to perform:

* [Associate the device to your user (Public Key Credential Creation)](doc/webauthn/PublicKeyCredentialCreation.md)
* [Check authentication request (Public Key Credential Request)](doc/webauthn/PublicKeyCredentialRequest.md)

Install the library with Composer: `composer require web-auth/webauthn-lib`.

## Symfony Bundles

This framework provides two bundles:

* **Webauthn Bundle**: this bundle uses the webauthn library to register services and attestation format supports. [The documentation can be found here](doc/symfony/index.md)
* **Webauthn Security Bundle**: this bundle adds a new firewall based on webauthn. You will be able to authenticate your users with their username and FIDO2 compatbile devices. [The documentation can be found here](doc/symfony-security/index.md)

## Other libraries

### FIDO U2F

FIDO U2F is an old protocol, but widely adopted by a lot of web services.
It adds a very robust and easy to use second factor authentication method.

The details for this lirary and the process are explained [in this dedicated page](doc/u2f/FIDO.md).

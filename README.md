Webauthn defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web
applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users.

This framework contains PHP libraries and Symfony bundle to allow developers to integrate that authentication mechanism
into their web applications.
